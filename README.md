## Please remember
ZCord needs strong hardware/machine to run as it's an "Human Verification" antibot and will use a lot of resources to deal with Captcha Generation + Loading and handling players. Found any errors, bugs or having questions? Join the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/GsSDWH34Tg) here. You can use my [Startup Flags](https://pastes.dev/8G4rmoNfb1) for optimization (BungeeCord haves GC and resize the memory to use by yourself).
## Minimum requirements:
Because this is an Limbo and Captcha Antibot style so it'll needs more resources to handle bots
- Recommended hostings are: OVH, Streamline, Bloom
- Recommended CPU vCores: >4 VCores
- Recommended Ram: >4 Gb (3Gb ram for the Proxy)
- Don't use Microsoft Azure because their firewall is shit
- You can use my iptables rules for better handling: [Pastes](https://pastes.dev/VhjpAYGnJg)
# Further version support-related updates will wait for Leymooo
